I'm a **graduate researcher** in the [Institute of Engineering Research](https://ioer.snu.ac.kr/) and am currently researching at [SPINS Lab](http://spins.snu.ac.kr/). My major research interests include urban remote sensing, land cover mapping, image fusion, renewable energy forecasting, and deep learning for sustainable development of cities and the environment.

I received my bachelor’s and master's degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yongil Kim](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongil_Kim). For my master's thesis, I researched local climate zone classification using multispectral satellite images via multi-scale convolutional neural networks. For my bachelor's thesis, I used DInSAR on Sentinel-1 images to detect North Korea's nuclear test site.

I will be starting my PhD studies at [UC Berkeley](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/) in the Dept. of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning under the supervision of Professor [John Radke](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/john-radke) and Professor [Marta Gonzalez](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez).
