I'm a **PhD candidate** in the Dept. of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at [UC Berkeley](https://ced.berkeley.edu/academics/landscape-architecture-environmental-planning/) under the supervision of Professor [John Radke](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/john-radke) and Professor [Marta Gonzalez](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez). Currently, I am interested in using GeoAI (computer vision, deep learning, network data science) to model natural hazards and predict risk for environmental planning and management. 

My ongoing research works include:

- Data-driven fire spread models using machine learning (Funded by C3.AI)
- Burn severity prediction and post-fire debris flow risk on critical infrastructure (Funded by Caltrans)

My previous research works sinclude urban remote sensing, land cover mapping, image fusion, renewable energy forecasting, and deep learning for sustainable development of cities and the environment. I received my bachelorâ€™s and master's degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Yongil Kim](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yongil_Kim) and was part of the [SPINS Lab](http://spins.snu.ac.kr/) reserach group. For my master's thesis, I researched local climate zone classification using multispectral satellite images via multi-scale convolutional neural networks. For my bachelor's thesis, I used DInSAR on Sentinel-1 images to detect North Korea's nuclear test site.
