abstract: Most spaceborne sensors have an inevitable tradeoff between spatial and spectral resolutions. This is a typical ill-posed inverse problem in the field of image fusion. To solve this problem, this letter proposes an image fusion method using spatial principal component analysis and modulation transfer function-based filters. The key behind the proposed fusion method is to efficiently estimate the missing spatial details by considering the spatial structures of the low-resolution multispectral (MS) imagery. Also, this letter proposes a newly developed injection gain model to resolve the local and global dissimilarity between panchromatic and MS imageries, which could prevent over- and under-injections. Finally, spatial details, optimized to be injected into the MS images, were constructed and paired with the developed injection gain model to produce high-resolution MS images. Two data sets acquired by WorldView-2 are employed for validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion method generates high-quality imagery in terms of both qualitative and quantitative standards.

abstract: In abrupt fire disturbances, high quality images suitable for wildfire damage assessment can be difficult to acquire. Quantifying wildfire burn area and severity are essential measures for quick short-term disaster response and efficient long-term disaster restoration. Planetscope (PS) imagery offers 3 m spatial and daily temporal resolution, which can overcome the spatio-temporal resolution tradeoff of conventional satellites, albeit at the cost of spectral resolution. This study investigated the potential of augmenting PS imagery by integrating the spectral information from Sentinel-2 (S2) differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to PS differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) using histogram matching,specifically for wildfire burn area and severity assessment of the Okgye wildfire which occurred on April 4th, 2019. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reference data, the results of the study were compared to the wildfire burn area reported by Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The burn area estimates from this study demonstrated that the histogram-matched (HM) PS dNDVI image produced more accurate burn area estimates and more descriptive burn severity intervals in contrast to conventional methods using S2. The HM PS dNDVI image returned an error of only 0.691% whereas the S2 dNDVI and dNBR images overestimated the wildfire burn area by 5.32% and 106%, respectively. These improvements using PS were largely due to the higher spatial resolution, allowing for the detection of sparsely distributed patches of land and narrow roads, which were indistinguishable using S2 dNBR. In addition, the integration of spectral information from S2 in the PS image resolved saturation effects in areas of low and high burn severity.
